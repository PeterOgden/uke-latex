\begin{song}{Bat Out Of Hell (Abridged)}{Meat Loaf}
\note{Intro} \C{Eb,F}\C{Eb,F}\C{Eb,F}\C{Bb}\C{Eb,F}\C{Bb}\\
\C{Eb}The \C{F}sirens are screaming in the \C{Bb}fires of hell way \C{F}down in the valley tonight\\
\C{Eb}There's a \C{F}man in the shadows with a \C{Am}gun in his eye and a \C{Bb}blade shining oh so bright\\ 
There's \C{F}evil in the air and there's \C{C}thunder in the sky and a \C{Dm}killer's on the blood\C{C}shot \C{Bb}streets \\
Oh and \C{F}down in the tunnel where the \C{C}deadly are rising  oh I \C{Dm}swear I saw a young boy \\
Down in the gutter he was \C{Bb}starting to foam in the \C{C}heat \C{C}\C{Bb}\C{C}\C{C}\\

Oh \C{Bb}Baby, you're the only thing in \C{C}this whole world that's \C{F}pure and good and \C{Bb}right \\
And wherever you are and wher\C{C}ever you go there's \C{Bb}always gonna \C{C}be some \C{F}light \\
But I \C{Bb}gotta get out I gotta \C{C}break it out now be\C{Dm}fore the final crack \C{C}of \C{Bb}dawn \C{Bb}\\ 
So we \C{F}gotta make the most of our \C{C}one night together \\
when it's \C{Bb}over you know we'll both be so a\C{C}lone \C{Bb}\C{C}\C{C}\\
\\
Like a \C{F}bat out of hell I'll be \C{Bb}gone when the morning \C{F}comes \\
When the night is over like a \C{Am}bat out of hell I'll be \C{Bb}gone \C{Am}gone \C{Gm}gone\\ 
Like a \C{F}bat out of hell I'll be \C{C}gone when the morning \C{Bb}comes\\ 
But when the \C{F}day is done and the \C{C}sun goes down and \C{Bb}moonlight's \C{Gm}shining \C{Gm}through\C{Am,Bb,C}\\ 
Then like a \C{F}sinner be\C{Am}fore the \C{Dm}gates of \C{Am7}heaven I'll come \C{Bb}crawling \C{BbMaj7}on back to \C{Gm7}you

\\
\C{Bb,Bb,Bb,Bb,C} \C{Bb,Bb,Bb,Bb,C}\\
I'm \C{F}gonna hit the highway like a \C{Bb}battering ram \\
On a \C{F}silver black phantom bike \C{F}\\
When the \C{F}metal is hot and the \C{Am}engine is hungry \\
And we're \C{Bb}all about to see the light \C{Bb}\\
\C{F}Nothing ever grows in this \C{C}rotting old hole \\
And \C{Dm}everything is stunted and \C{C}lost \C{Bb}\\
And \C{F}nothing really rocks And \C{C}nothing really rolls \\
And \C{Bb}nothing's ever \C{C}worth the \C{F}cost\\
\\
And I \C{Bb}know that I'm \C{C}damned if I \C{F}never get out \\
And \C{Bb}maybe I'm \C{C}damned if I \C{F}do \\
But with \C{Bb}every other \C{C}beat I got \C{Dm}left in my heart \C{Dm}\\
You know I'd \C{Bb}rather be \C{C}damned with \C{F}you\\ 
Well, If I \C{F}gotta be damned you know I \C{C}wanna be damned \\
\C{Bb}Dancing through the \C{C}night with \C{F}you \\
If I \C{F}gotta be damned you know I \C{C}wanna be damned \\
\C{F}Gotta be damned you know I \C{Bb}wanna be damned \\
\C{F}Gotta be damned you know I \C{C}wanna be \C{Dm}damned \\
\C{Bb7}Dancing through the night, Dancing through the night\\ 
 Dancing through the \C{C}night with \C{F}you \\
\C{F5,E5,D5,C5} \C{F5,E5,D5,C5} \C{F5,E5,D5,C5} \C{F5,E5,D5,C5} \C{C} \C{C}\\
\note{Repeat box}

Then like a \C{F}sinner be\C{Am}fore the \C{Dm}gates of \C{Am7}heaven I'll come \C{Bb}crawling\\ \C{BbMaj7}on back to \C{Gm7}you
