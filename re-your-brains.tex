\begin{song}{Re: Your Brains}{Jonathan Coulton}

\C{Am} Heya Tom, it's \C{F}Bob from the \C{C}office down the hall \C{G}\\
\C{Am}Good to see you \C{F}buddy, how've you \C{G}been \C{Gsus4,G}\\
\C{Fdim7}Things have been OK for me ex\C{Am}cept that I'm a \C{Am7}zombie now\\
\C{D7} I really wish you'd let us \C{G}in.\\
I \C{F}think I speak for \C{C}all of us when I \C{E7}say I under\C{Am}stand\\
\C{F}Why you folks might \C{C}hesitate to sub\C{E7}mit to our de\C{Am}mand\\
But \C{F}here's an FYI: \C{Fm}you're all gonna die.. screaming\\
\\
\note{chorus - double strums on each chord}\\
\C{C}All we \C{G}want to do is \C{F}eat your brains \C{G}\\
We're not un\C{C}reasonable, I mean, \C{G}no-one's going to eat your \C{F,Am,F,Am,F,Am,F,G}eyes.\\
\C{C}All we \C{G}want to do is \C{F}eat your brains \C{G}\\
We're at an \C{Am}impasse here, \C{Em} maybe we should \C{F,Am,F,Am,F,Am,F,G}compromise:\\
If you \C{F}open \C{Am}up the \C{Dm}doors\\
\C{F}We'll all \C{Am}come in\C{F}side and \C{G}eat your \C{C}brains.\\
\\
\C{Am}I don't want to \C{F}nitpick, Tom, but is \C{C}this really your plan?\C{G}\\
\C{Am}To spend your whole life \C{F}locked inside a \C{G}mall? \C{Gsus4,G}\\
\C{Fdim7}Maybe that's OK for now but \C{Am}someday you'll be \C{Am7}out of food and guns\\
\C{D7} and the you'll have to make the \C{G}call.\\
I'm \C{F}not suprised to \C{C}see you haven't \C{E7}thought it through e\C{Am}nough\\
You \C{F}never had the \C{C}head for all that \C{E7} bigger picture \C{Am}stuff.\\
But \C{F}Tom that's what I do, and I \C{Fm}plan on eating you.. slowly\\
\\
\note{chorus - finishing with}\\
\C{F}We'll all \C{Am}come in\C{F}side and \C{G}eat your \C{Ab}brains.\\
\\
I'd like to \C{Eb}help you Tom in \C{Gdim7}any way I \C{Db}can\\
I sure ap\C{Dbm}preciate the way you're working \C{Ab}with me\\
I'm not a \C{Eb}monster Tom, well \C{Gdim7}technically I \C{Fm}am\\
I guess I \C{C}am\\
\\
\note{Instrumental - same as chorus}\\
\C{C}\C{G}\C{F}\C{G}\C{C}\C{G}\C{F,Am,F,Am,F,Am,F,G}\\
\C{C}\C{G}\C{F}\C{G}\C{Am}\C{Em}\C{F,Am,F,Am,F,Am,F,Am}\\
\\
\C{Am} I've got another \C{F}meeting Tom, maybe \C{C}we could wrap it up \C{G}\\
\C{Am}I know we'll get to \C{F}common ground some\C{G}how \C{Gsus4,G}\\
\C{Fdim7}Meanwhile I'll report back to my \C{Am}colleagues who were \C{Am7}chewing on the doors\\
\C{D7} I guess we'll table this for \C{G}now\\
I'm \C{F}glad to see  you \C{C}take constructive \C{E7}criticism \C{Am}well\\
\C{F}Thank you for the \C{C}time I know we're \C{E7}all busy as \C{Am}hell\\
And we'll \C{F}put this thing to bed  \C{Fm}when I bash your head.. open\\
\\
\note{chorus - finishing with}\\
\C{F}We'll all \C{Am}come in\C{F}side and \C{G}eat your \C{C}brains.\C{Csus4,C}\\
